You can think of the information_schema.tables as a dummy table with no real 
use in the statement except to satisfy the MySQL condition that every SELECT 
must have a FROM

Also, it contains as many rows as you could possibly need so it is a neat trick 
for incrementing variables. Just select the incrementing variable from the table
 and specify the where condition on your incrementing variable.

declare @row int = 1
while (@row < 21)
begin
    print replicate('* ', @row)
    set @row = @row + 1
end

set @row := 0;
select repeat('* ', @row := @row + 1) from information_schema.tables where @row < 20

set @number = 0;
select repeat('* ', @number := @number + 1) from information_schema.tables limit 20;
