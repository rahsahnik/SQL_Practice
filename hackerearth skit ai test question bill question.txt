create table bill
( 
  type varchar(5),
  num varchar(12),
  dur int
);
  
  insert into bill values
  ('OUT',1818,13),
  ('IN', 1818,10),
  ('OUT',1818,7),
  ('OUT',1817,15),
  ('IN',1817,18),
  ('IN',1819,18),
  ('OUT',1819,40),
  ('IN',1819,18)

MY solution not working :

select a.num
from 
(select num,sum(dur) as D
 from bill  
 where type ='OUT'
 group by num) a ,

(select num,sum(dur) as D
 		from bill  
 		 where type ='IN'
			group by num) b 
        
where a.D > b.D
group by a.num
order by 1

MY Working :

select num from 

(select num ,
 case  WHEN type ='OUT' then dur else 0 end as O,
 case when type='IN' then dur else 0   end   as I
 from bill
 )temp
 
 group by num
 having sum(O) > sum(I)

Working solution , below are 2 of them :

SELECT num
FROM (
    SELECT num,
           SUM(CASE WHEN type = 'OUT' THEN dur ELSE 0 END) outval, 
           SUM(CASE WHEN type = 'IN' THEN dur ELSE 0 END) inval
    FROM bill  
    WHERE type in ('IN','OUT')
    GROUP BY num
) t1
WHERE outval > inval

---------------

SELECT num
FROM bill
GROUP BY num
HAVING SUM(CASE WHEN type = 'OUT' THEN dur ELSE 0 END) > SUM(CASE WHEN type = 'IN' THEN dur ELSE 0 END);
