--SQL Project Planning

If the End_Date of the tasks are consecutive, then they are part of the same project. 
Samantha is interested in finding the total number of different projects completed.

Write a query to output the start and end dates of projects listed by the number of days 
it took to complete the project in ascending order. If there is more than one project that have
 the same number of completion days, then order by the start date of the project.

SELECT Start_Date, MIN(End_Date)
FROM 

    (SELECT Start_Date FROM Projects WHERE Start_Date NOT IN (SELECT End_Date FROM Projects)) a,
    (SELECT End_date FROM PROJECTS WHERE end_date NOT IN (SELECT start_date FROM PROJECTS)) b
/* At this point, we should have a list of start dates and end dates that don't necessarily correspond with each other */
/* This makes sure we only choose end dates that fall after the start date, and choosing the MIN means for the particular start_date,
 we get the closest end date that does not coincide with the start of another task */

where start_date < end_date
GROUP BY start_date
ORDER BY datediff(start_date, MIN(end_date)) desc, start_date

For MS SQL users:

SELECT T1.Start_Date,T2.End_Date 
FROM ( SELECT Start_Date,ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY Start_Date) RN 
		FROM Projects WHERE Start_Date NOT IN (SELECT END_Date FROM Projects) ) AS T1 
INNER JOIN (

SELECT End_Date,ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY End_Date) RN 
FROM Projects WHERE End_Date NOT IN (SELECT Start_Date FROM Projects)) AS T2
 ON T1.RN = T2.RN 
ORDER BY DATEDIFF(Day,T1.Start_Date,T2.End_Date),T1.Start_Date

Note :

The way to solve this problem is to find Start_date that is not in End_Date and End_Date that is not in Start_Date.
Why? because if a Start_date is not in EndDate, it means it is a new project. And if a End_Date is not in Start_Date,
 it means this End_Date is the End_Date of a project.
We Gerenate a row number and Order by start_date so that it can match the Project's EndDate.
Same logic, We Gerenate a row number and Order by End_date so that it can match the Project's StartDate.
If a rownumber from Start_Date match the rownumber from End_Date, they must be the start_Date and End_Date in the same project.
