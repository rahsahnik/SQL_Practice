-PIVOT concept using 2 ways : more resource   https://www.sqlservertutorial.net/sql-server-basics/sql-server-pivot/

1. 

SELECT
    [Doctor], [Professor], [Singer], [Actor]
FROM
(
    SELECT ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY OCCUPATION ORDER BY NAME) [RowNumber], * FROM OCCUPATIONS
) AS tempTable
PIVOT
(
    MAX(NAME) FOR OCCUPATION IN ([Doctor], [Professor], [Singer], [Actor])
) AS pivotTable

2.

Note: 
MIN is used in a SELECT statement that scans more than one line. It takes a column as an argument, 
and returns the "lowest" value (again, according to the collation sequence) found in that column.

Used without a GROUP BY clause, the result set will have a single row, and the value of MIN will be the 
lowest value found in that column. Used with a GROUP BY clause, the result set will have one row for each group 
and the value of MIN will be the lowest value in that column for any row in the group.

SET @r1=0,@r2=0,@r3=0,@r4=0;
SELECT MIN(Doctor),MIN(Professor),MIN(Singer),MIN(Actor)

FROM (
SELECT CASE
    WHEN OCCUPATION = 'Doctor' THEN (@r1:=@r1+1)
    WHEN OCCUPATION = 'Professor' THEN (@r2:=@r2+1)
    WHEN OCCUPATION = 'Singer' THEN (@r3:=@r3+1)
    WHEN OCCUPATION = 'Actor' THEN (@r4:=@r4+1) END AS RowNumber,
    CASE WHEN OCCUPATION = 'Doctor' THEN Name END AS Doctor,
    CASE WHEN OCCUPATION = 'Professor' THEN Name END AS Professor,
    CASE WHEN OCCUPATION = 'Singer' THEN Name END AS Singer,
    CASE WHEN OCCUPATION = 'Actor' THEN Name END AS Actor
FROM OCCUPATIONS
ORDER BY Name) as temp
group by RowNumber
